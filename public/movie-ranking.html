<h3>Barbie</h3>
<p>Could it live up to the hype? Would we end up just remembering the memes and how, for a short time in the summer of 2023, everything suddenly turned pink? The answers, it turned out, were ‘yes’ and ‘no’. When Greta Gerwig’s fuchsia-hued fantasia finally arrived in cinemas, it delivered all the promised silliness, mockery and straight-up Kenergy, sending Margot Robbie’s living doll on a journey of empowerment with Ryan Gosling’s insecure Ken in hot pursuit. What we hadn’t expected was how all-in Gerwig and Noah Baumbach’s screenplay goes on Jordan Peterson-style meninism and even the movie’s own paymasters at Mattel (represented by a roomful of men in suits and Will Ferrell’s windbag CEO). She and Robbie promised we’d love it regardless of how we felt about Barbie – and she was right.</p>

<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>Even on IMAX, the seismic themes and ideas spill over the sides of Christopher Nolan's most spectacular, cerebral and haunting blockbuster yet. Cillian Murphy is brooding and briliiant as the titular physicist, J Robert Oppenheimer, charting his quest to build America the A-bomb in a science-fact thriller that’s paced like a chain reaction. The film’s jaw-dropping centrepiece – the first atomic bomb test – gives you a sense of what the first audiences to see 2001: A Space Odyssey must have felt 50-odd years ago. In a world of CGI, Nolan opts to recreate it using practical effects (a don’t-try-it-at-home mix of gasoline, aluminium powder, magnesium and propane). Like the movie itself, it leaves you shaken to the core.></p>

<h3>Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1</h3>
<p>Tom Cruise’s willingness to do literally any bastard-mad thing to entertain us finds its purest expression in the seventh instalment of the consistently excellent Mission: Impossible movies. He sprints, freefalls, races and horse-rides through a series of gawp-worthy action set pieces, occasionally while handcuffed to Hayley Atwell’s terrified franchise newbie, all expertly executed by writer-director Christopher McQuarrie. And the plot? Hard to say, this being the first part of a Dead Reckoning twofer and with multiple strands yet to be tied together, but it’s smart-baffling in the best M:I tradition. Kudos, too, to charisma machine Esai Morales, who somehow makes dialogue about A.I. sexy as the superbad, Gabriel. </p>
