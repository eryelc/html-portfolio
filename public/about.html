<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there, pals! I'm Patches, the fur-tastic superstar of this show! 🌟 My birthday is on November 8, and I'm turning 11 years young this 2023. I might not have a fancy pedigree, but my cuteness level is off the charts!</p>

 <p>Let me bark to you about my favorites – nothing gets my tail wiggling like Denta Stix and Treatos. And when it's mealtime, bring on the Chimken, Spam, or Corned Beef – I'm all in! But there are a few things that ruffle my fur, like houseflies (they're too speedy for me), strong winds (I prefer a good hair day), thunderstorms, and rain (puddles are just a no-go). The vacuum? Well, let's not even go there. 😱</p>
  
  <p>I'm not just a lone ranger; I'm part of an incredible family. There's Mama, a former air force superstar (totally cool), and Papa, the strong, silent type I'm trying to charm. And then there are my four amazing human sisters, Mami Yheng, Ate Buds, Ate Pwet Pwet, and Ate Mai Mai. They take care of me and love me 100%. It's like having a built-in fan club! Tetay is a little quirky with me, but I'm on a mission to make her my BFF.</p>
  
 <p>My hobbies? It's a wild ride of eat, bark, and snooze – and I must say, I've got those skills down to paw-fection! Life's a wag-tastic adventure, and I'm thrilled to have you join me on it! 🐾💫</p>
